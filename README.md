Iron Ore Price Forecasting using AutoGluon

This project demonstrates the use of AutoGluon: Time Series Forecasting for forecasting iron ore prices. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The results show the model's predictions and the calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE), providing insights into the model's performance. This is a univariate time series forecasting project, focusing on the prediction of iron ore prices based on historical price data. Various models including ETS, Theta, and DeepAR (Neural Network) were utilized, and a weighted ensemble model was used to select the best-performing model.
